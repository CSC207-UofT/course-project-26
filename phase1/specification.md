# Group 26 - Specification - Phase 1

Profile system
Users in our database system can now have access to their profile which includes their personal information as well as 
the login information. They are also now able to edit their profile, such as changing the address, uoft email address 
as well as the password.

ConsoleUI can print and read the data we type. Until we get
the data from the user, then the controller can decide to display
user or to update student. The controller will use some service
to work with the entity, it can do things like CRUD, create,
read, update, or delete.
