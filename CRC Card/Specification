The main purpose of this project is to create a secondary hand book platform, exclusive for the students in University
of Toronto.

There are two child classes of the User class, they are the Seller and the Buyer. Seller can post unwanted books onto
the web platform, specially, create a Book with instances such as, the name, the price, the picture of the cover, etc,
onto the platform. While the Buyer can then search for the books that he wants, if there is one, then the platform will
send notification, including other personâ€™s email, to both person.

The Platform includes two child classes, Register and Login. Register would check if user is already registered and
check if the given password matches the correct password. Login allows user to login the web.
